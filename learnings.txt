# To add vertical lines in a plot
plt.axvline(numeric_val, color="red", linestyle="--", label="xyz")

# Use loops or make functions to plot repetitive graphs

# Using different ways to plot multiple graphs eg using sub plots

# SMOTE technique

# Using pickle file 

# To find prediction probablity

pred_prob = model.predict_proba(input_data_df)
It returns a 2D array, where each row corresponds to a sample, and each column corresponds to a class.
The values are the probabilities that a sample belongs to each class.

pred_prob[0]  # Might look like: [0.3, 0.7]  for 0 or 1 classification
30% probability the sample is class 0 and 70% of class 1
